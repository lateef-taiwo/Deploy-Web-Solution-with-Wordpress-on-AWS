# Deploy-Web-Solution-with-Wordpress-on-AWS
This repository explains the steps involved in  preparing storage infrastructure on two Linux servers and implementinga basic web solution using WordPress.

You will gain practical experience that demonstrates `three-tier architecture` while also making sure that the Linux servers' storage disks are properly partitioned and maintained using tools like `gdisk` and `LVM`, respectively. 

### The 3-Tier Setup
1. A Laptop or PC to serve as a client
2. An EC2 Linux Server as a web server (This is where you will install WordPress)
3. An EC2 Linux server as a database (DB) server
